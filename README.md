# Description

I did my DsA class in C++ ([here](https://github.com/LordGoatius/C-Portfolio)), but I wanted more, so I'm doing it all in C now.

# Current Structures

- Linked List
    - Bubble Sort
    - Quicksort
- Vector
- BST
- Schedule Sort (okay this one requires an explanation)
    - There was a meme of a sorting algorithm where the Linux scheduler would act as a priority queue for a sort, where for each element a thread is created which appends the value to the vector, and the thread is given the priority of the value. So I made it. It doesn't work, because arbitrarily assigning priorities to a thread is not guaranteed to work, but it kinda shuffles it.
